With so many of the best things to do in the Amalfi Coast, you’ll be spoilt for choice and will need to prioritise what and how you actually want to see.  It’s the kind of place you visit and know instantly that you’ll love (and rightly so).  It really is beautiful here. </br>

        There is just so much to see and do, that doesn’t just involve being terrified by the roads. </br>Those colourful villages homes, staggered on terraced cliffs, fragrant lemon groves, delicious freshly made Italian food and turquoise waters, pretty much make this a dream spot. </br>

        You’ll be spoilt for choice when thinking of the best things to do in the Amalfi Coast, especially as it’s so vast. </br>
